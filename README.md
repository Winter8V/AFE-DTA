# AFE-DTA: Adaptive Feature Enhancement for Drug-Target Affinity Prediction
AFE-DTA integrates the Graph Encoding Adaptive Feature Fusion module (GEAFF), Bidirectional Cross Attention module (BCAM), and Learnable Spline Transform Network (LST-Net). It effectively addresses the over-smoothing problem of GCN and better captures complex interaction features.
